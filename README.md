# Mall-Customer-Segmentation
A customer segmentation of mall customers using unsupervised machine learning<br /> 
SHOPPING CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION<br />
A customer segmentation of mall customers using unsupervised machine learning (Clustering)<br />
PROBLEM STATEMENT<br />
Understand the target customers for the marketing team to plan a strategy<br />
CONTEXT<br />
Your boss wants you to identify the most important shopping groups based on income, age, and the mall shopping score.<br />
He wants the ideal number of groups with a label for each.<br />
OBJECTIVE MARKET SEGMENTATION<br />
Divide your mall target market into approachable groups. Create subsets of a market based on demographics behavioral criteria to better understand the target for marketing activities.<br />
THE APPROACH<br />
1.	Perform some quick EDA<br />
2.	Use KMEANS and clustering Algorithm to create our segments<br />
3.	Use Summary Statistics on the clusters<br />
4.	Visualize<br />

ANALYSIS<br />
Target Cluste<br />r
Target group would be cluster 1 which has high Spending Score and high income<br />
60% of cluster 1 shoppers are women. We should look for ways to attract these customers using a market campaign targeting popular items in this cluster<br />
Cluster 2 presents an interesting opportunity to market to the customers for sales event on popular items.<br />
